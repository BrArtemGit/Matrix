A project that will work with two-dimensional matrices.The windowed application is capable of creating matrices of various sizes with random values.
There are also functions for sorting all rows or columns, or sorting a specific row or column.
It is possible to rotate the matrix 90 degrees in both directions.

Various mathematical analysis and graph visualization functions will be introduced soon.
